### To Be Noted
 * For Week 2 assignments only, the code should be run at <a href="https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//course1/example/index.php">Duke University Code Environment</a> as all the libraries and images are hosted there.
 * For Week 3 assignments/practises only, copy/paste the code at <a href="https://codepen.io/">CODEPEN</a> as it's much easier to see the live output of your code there.


### Update
I finished the course on Aug 11 2020 with 100% grade and Honors. View my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/UULDLNA62M73">certificate</a>.
